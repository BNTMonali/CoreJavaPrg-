extremely important for Wikipedia. As a free encyclopedia with the goal of democratizing knowledge,
 Wikipedia serves an extremely diverse audience with a wide range of backgrounds, preparation, 
 interests, and goals. Even in the most technically demanding subjects, these readers include not
  only subject experts but also students and curious laypeople. While upholding the goals of accuracy and
   neutrality, every effort should be made to also render articles accessible and pleasant to read for the
    broadest audience.

Some editors conflate the encyclopedic style with the spare and technically
 precise style found in scholarly monographs and peer-reviewed papers aimed at a 
 specialist audience. Encyclopedic style means the text is straight to the point, without needing to twist the
  truth or tell "lies for the children". However, encyclopedia articles should also be easily understood by as 
  general an audience as practical, avoiding the assumption of prerequisite knowledge and gratuitous use of 
  specialized jargon and advanced technical notation: these shortcuts which save time and effort for experts can 
  easily become barriers for the uninitiated.
